# 📄Overview 
My name is Jaylen Hayden and I am an app dev student at Year Up United. This application is the backend side of the capstone project that was given to me, in order to demonstrate my understanding of API's, debugging, and working with an existing codebase.
The front end is a clothing store website, located in another repository called "ecommerce-web" and was relatively untouched by me.
